## About Me
Hi! I'm Vadim. I started my career path as a crisis manager been a fourth year student of the BSEU. I've consistently developed my financial management skills and worked my way from a finance manager to head of finance of one of the leading automobile company of Belarus. I like complex tasks that can get me out of my comfort zone, that's the proper way to grow and to get the satisfaction of my life. I want to switch my career road to Frontend Development, that's a great challenge for me I've always dreamed about. Now it's time to come it true.
